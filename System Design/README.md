All the important term explain in term of Pizza Shop 
1. Vertical Scalling (Single Chef)
2. Pre Request Preparation (Single Chef with more work in extra working hours and give hime extra {Cron Jobs})
3. Master Slave Architecture (Backup) (Keep one temperory chef who will support when Main Chef sick)
4. Horizontal Scalling (Keep 3 Main Chefs and 3 Backup chefs)
5. Microservices (Keep sapertae request according to their speciallity 1 chefs for Garlic Pizza , 1 for Onion Pizza , 1 for Garlic Bread )
6. Distrubuted System (2 more shops so we will not blocker because of 1 system )
7. Load balancer (Route the request according to system nearest(Time) and avalability status )
8. Decoupling (According to Item send the request in their shop means a shop having burger available so will take the order and send back to shop2 )
9. Logging and Matrics calculation (Any blocker like bike is got stuck , system will see the logs and findout the issue event by event debugging )
10. Extensible (System should be large extensiable like in future any new category comes so system will easily manage . Example Swiggy easily started Swiggy Instamart because it has already system only they have to Keep some small inhancement and they were succeed )

I have talked about how to learn System Design or High-Level Design(HLD) as a beginner. I have discussed what are the best resources for learning System Design like how to use educative.io courses. This will help you to transition from an SDE-1 to an SDE-2 role at any company.

I have covered all the concepts that are mandatory to learn system design and the standard problems you need to know before going to the interview. 

Important Concepts
1. Scalability
2. Performance
3. Latency and Throughput
4. Consistency
5. Availability
6. Partition Tolerance
7. CAP Theorem
8. Domain Name System
9. Content Delivery Network
10. Load Balancers and Reverse Proxy
11. Microservices
12. Databases
13. Caching
14. Message Queues
