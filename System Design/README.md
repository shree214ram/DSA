I have talked about how to learn System Design or High-Level Design(HLD) as a beginner. I have discussed what are the best resources for learning System Design like how to use educative.io courses. This will help you to transition from an SDE-1 to an SDE-2 role at any company.

I have covered all the concepts that are mandatory to learn system design and the standard problems you need to know before going to the interview. 

Important Concepts
1. Scalability
2. Performance
3. Latency and Throughput
4. Consistency
5. Availability
6. Partition Tolerance
7. CAP Theorem
8. Domain Name System
9. Content Delivery Network
10. Load Balancers and Reverse Proxy
11. Microservices
12. Databases
13. Caching
14. Message Queues
