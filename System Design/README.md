#### Introduction of System Design 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsPSJvH2mew&t=433s

```
I have talked about how to learn System Design or High-Level Design(HLD) as a beginner. I have discussed what are the best resources for learning System Design like how to use educative.io courses. This will help you to transition from an SDE-1 to an SDE-2 role at any company.

I have covered all the concepts that are mandatory to learn system design and the standard problems you need to know before going to the interview. 
```
#### Important Concepts
1. Scalability :- How we can scale our system Or how we can build a system so millions of user can use in single time And How can so much traffic can be handle on system
   1. Horizontal
   2. Vertical Scaling

    System Design Basics: Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling
   
2. Performance:- How we can increase the  performance of our system in terms of scability and traffic control 
3. Latency and Throughput :- Response time of system and how its impacted in terms of scability and performance . Howmuch numbers of request comming in system 
4. Consistency :- is our system consistent or not , Is our system returning same data for every api call 
    1. strongly consistent 
    2. weekly consistent 
    3. eventualy consistent 
    ###### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaRkONvyGr8
    What is Consistent Hashing and Where is it used?
    1. make a circle and 
    2. use hash function to distribute server 
    3. Load balancing and availability will be improved from this 
    4. nearest server will be reachable first by request near by 
    5. We can add more vertual server with the help of More Hash function

    1. To Save Network Call
    2. To Avoid Recomputation 
    3. ToReduce DB Load 
    Redis :-
    LRU 
    1. Server Cheche 
    2. Database Cheche 
    3. Globle Chache 

        Write Through 
        Write Back
14. Message Queues
    ###### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUJbuFMyBDk
    What is a Message Queue and Where is it used?

    With Pizza shop example and Load balancer , there is a very important thing in Sysytem Design is

=========== Gaurav Sen System Design Introduction in term of Pizza Shop ==============

# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcXvc3ZmRU

All the important term explain in term of Pizza Shop 

Systems design is the use of computer engineering principles to build large scale distributed systems. It involves converting business problems and requirements into technical solutions. Senior engineers use system design patterns to make reliable, scalable and maintainable systems.

We mention 10 tips/terms used by engineers when designing systems:

00:00 Intro
00:38 Vertical scaling
01:07 Preprocessing using cron jobs
01:31 Backup servers
02:12 Horizontal scaling
02:37 Microservices
04:00 Distributed Systems
05:24 Load Balancing
06:39 Decoupling
07:15 Logging and metrics calculation
07:45 Extensibility
08:38 Low level system design

System Design Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...


1. Vertical Scalling (Single Chef)
2. Pre Request Preparation (Single Chef with more work in extra working hours and give him extra {Cron Jobs})
3. Master Slave Architecture (Backup) (Keep one temperory chef who will support when Main Chef sick)
4. Horizontal Scalling (Keep 3 Main Chefs and 3 Backup chefs)
5. Microservices (Keep sapertae request according to their speciallity 1 chefs for Garlic Pizza , 1 for Onion Pizza , 1 for Garlic Bread )
6. Distrubuted System (2 more shops so we will not blocker because of 1 system )
7. Load balancer (Route the request according to system nearest(Time) and avalability status )
8. Decoupling (According to Item send the request in their shop means a shop having burger available so will take the order and send back to shop2 )
9. Logging and Matrics calculation (Any blocker like bike is got stuck , system will see the logs and findout the issue event by event debugging )
10. Extensible (System should be large extensiable like in future any new category comes so system will easily manage . Example Swiggy easily started Swiggy Instamart because it has already system only they have to Keep some small inhancement and they were succeed )
