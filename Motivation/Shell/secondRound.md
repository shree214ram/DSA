1. React 
    write code for show an api list data with react 
2. Node 
    write code show an api list data with react 

Note :
    I have given 2 mistakes 
   1. I have written the react code and shown the list but i should not write all the code at single file i should write in different child componenet and applied all latest feature of Recat for batter performance like 
        1. Recat Memo 
        2. UseCallback
    
   2. I have written node express api but doing some silly mistakes in app.listen function forget to give url with dynamic port . and i was trying with localhost even in my local .host file it was not configured . I should use http://127.0.0.1:3000
