Talk about cases where you will use one over other.","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Both **CHAR** and **VARCHAR** data types store characters up to specified length. \n\n1. **CHAR** stores characters of fixed length while **VARCHAR** can store characters of variable length. \n2. Storage and retrieval of data is different in **CHAR** and **VARCHAR**. \n3. **CHAR** internally takes fixed space, and if stored character length is small, it is padded by trailing space characters. **VARCHAR** has 1 or 2 byte prefix along with stored characters. \n4. **CHAR** has slightly better performance. \n5. **CHAR** has memory allocation equivalent to the maximum size specified while **VARCHAR** has variable length memory allocation."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Describe `BLOB` in MySQL. What is it used for?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"**BLOB** or Binary Large Object can be used to store binary data in MySQL. Sometimes binary data like images need to be stored in SQL databases. For example you might want to store user photos along with other user details in the database table. Binary data of the user photo can be saved as a **BLOB**. By using **BLOB**, we will not require separate storage for images. **BLOB** helps in removing complexity and providing portability in such cases.\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is _self referencing_ foreign key? Give an example.","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A foreign key which is stored in a table itself is called to be **self referencing foreign key**. \n\nFor example consider an *Employee* database table. It has *employee_id* as primary key as well as a *manager_id* which is *employee_id* of his manager. If we create a foreign key constraint, as a manager is also an employee, *manager_id* will reference to *empolyee_id* in the same table. The *Employee* table with self referencing foreign key *manager_id* can be created using below statement.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE `Employee`( \n`name` VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL, \n`employee_id` CHAR(9) NOT NULL, \n`manager_id` CHAR(9) NOT NULL, \n`salary` decimal(10,2) NULL,  \nPRIMARY KEY(`employee_id`),\nFOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES employee(employee_id) ON DELETE CASCADE\n);\n```"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the difference between `TRUNCATE` and `DELETE`?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"* **DELETE** is a Data Manipulation Language(DML) command. It can be used for deleting some specified rows from a table. **DELETE** command can be used with **WHERE** clause.\n\n* **TRUNCATE** is a Data Definition Language(DDL) command. It deletes all the records of a particular table. **TRUNCATE** command is faster in comparison to **DELETE**. While **DELETE** command can be rolled back, **TRUNCATE** can not be rolled back in MySQL.\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the difference between _Data Definition Language (DDL)_ and _Data Manipulation Language (DML)_?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"* **Data definition language (DDL)** commands are the commands which are used to define the database. **CREATE**, **ALTER**, **DROP** and **TRUNCATE** are some common DDL commands.\n\n* **Data manipulation language (DML)** commands are commands which are used for manipulation or modification of data. **INSERT**, **UPDATE** and **DELETE** are some common DML commands."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Explain the use of `FEDERATED` tables in MySQL","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"**FEDERATED** tables are tables through which MySQL provides a way to access database tables located in remote database servers. Actual physical data resides in remote machine but the table can be accessed like a local table. To use a federated table **ENGINE=FEDERATED** and a connection string containing user, remote hostname, port, schema and table name are provided in **CREATE TABLE** command something like below.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE table_fed (\n ... \n)\nENGINE=FEDERATED\nCONNECTION='mysql://user@remote_hostname:port/federated_schema/table';\n```"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Explain `GRANT` command in MySQL","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"When a new MySQL user is created, he requires certain privileges to perform various database operations. **GRANT** command grants certain privileges to the user.\nFor example below statement grants permission to run **SELECT** and **INSERT** on **TABLE** *customertable* to user *username@localhost*.\n\n```sql\nGRANT SELECT, INSERT ON customertable TO 'username'@'localhost'\n```"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Both `TIMESTAMP` and `DATETIME` are used to store data and time. Explain difference between them and when should one be used?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Both **TIMESTAMP** and **DATETIME** store date time in *YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS* format. While **DATETIME** stores provided date time, **TIMESTAMP** first converts provided time to UTC while storing and then again converts it back to server time zone upon retrieval. So if you need to serve different users in different countries using same time data, **TIMESTAMP** facilitates it. **DATETIME** simply stores provided date time without making any time zone related conversion."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the difference between commands  `create database` and `create schema` in MySQL?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Terms **database** and **schema** are synonymous in MySQL.  Some other enterprise level databases like Oracle and Microsoft SQL server make distinction  between database and schema. A MySQL developer can interchangeably use both the terms. For example a database called *test* can be created by using either of the CREATE statements below. \n```sql\n    CREATE DATABASE test;\n    CREATE SCHEMA test;\n ```"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is _Stored Function_ in MySQL. How are they different from _Stored Procedure_?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"**Stored function** is a stored complex logic which can be executed like a function call from any other statement. It returns a single value. It can be used to store business logic and formulas in database. Stored functions can even run **SELECT** command or table manipulation commands like **INSERT** and **UPDATE**.\n\n**The most general difference between procedures and functions is that they are invoked differently and for different purposes:**\n\n1.  A procedure does not return a value. Instead, it is invoked with a CALL statement to perform an operation such as modifying a table or processing retrieved records.\n2.  A function is invoked within an expression and returns a single value directly to the caller to be used in the expression.\n3.  You cannot invoke a function with a CALL statement, nor can you invoke a procedure in an expression.\n\ne.g. `SELECT get_foo(myColumn) FROM mytable` is not valid if `get_foo()` is a procedure, but you can do that if `get_foo()` is a function. The price is that functions have more limitations than a procedure.\n\n```sql\nCREATE PROCEDURE proc_name ([parameters])\n [characteristics]\n routine_body\n\n\nCREATE FUNCTION func_name ([parameters])\n RETURNS data_type       // diffrent\n [characteristics]\n routine_body\n```"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the use of `DELIMETER` command in MySQL?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"MySQL workbench or MySQL client use **;** as delimiter to separate different statements. **DELIMITER** command can be used to change delimiter in MySQL from **;** to something else. It is used while writing trigger and stored procedures in MySQL. Command below make **//** as delimiter.\n\n```sql \nDELIMITER //\n```\nFor example in a stored procedure, **\";\"**  is part of the actual stored procedure and  not a delimiter. So while writing a stored procedure, we can make something else like // as delimiter and afterward revert it back by calling below command.\n\n```sql\nDELIMITER ;\n```"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is difference between `BLOB` and `TEXT` in MySQL?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"* **BLOB** data types are designed to store binary data like picture or video in database. \n* **TEXT** data types  are designed to store large text data. \n\n**BLOB** stores binary byte string while **TEXT** stores character string. Although **BLOB** can be used for storing text data, **TEXT** data types support sorting and comparison around text which is not supported by **BLOB**. \n \nThere are four **TEXT** data types including **TINYTEXT**, **TEXT**, **MEDIUMTEXT** and **LONGTEXT** which can hold up to 255 characters, 65,535 characters, 16,777,215 characters and 4,294,967,295 characters respectively. Similarly four related **BLOB** types including **TINYBLOB**, **BLOB**, **MEDIUMBLOB** and **LONGBLOB** can hold up to 255 bytes, 65,535 bytes, 16,777,215 bytes and 4,294,967,295 bytes respectively. "}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How can `ENUM` be used in MySQL. Give an example.","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"`ENUM`  can be used to set a column as **enum** type. `ENUM` in MySQL is string object which can take one of the permitted value. In example below, _country_ column can have one of the three values provided:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE `Student`(\n`rollnumber` INT NOT NULL, \n`name` VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL, \n`country` ENUM('USA', 'UK', 'Australia'), \nPRIMARY KEY(`rollnumber`));\n```\n\nConsider:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Student` values('6', 'John', 'USA');\n```"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is `AUTO INCREMENT` in MySQL? Explain with an example.","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"* **AUTO INCREMENT** in MySQL is used to automatically assign next unique integer value to a particular column. \n\n* **AUTO INCREMENT** can be used to generate unique id for each inserted row without assigning a value to it. In MySQL, only columns which keep unique values like column with **UNIQUE CONSTRAINT** or **PRIMARY KEY** can be marked for **AUTO INCREMENT**. A table can have only one column marked for **AUTO INCREMENT**. \n\nCode below can be used to mark *studentid* in *Student* table to auto increment. On adding a new *Student* without providing *studentid*, a unique student id with next available value is generated and assigned to the row.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE `student`(`studentid` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,  `name` VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(`studentid`));\n```"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"A multiple column index is created over `firstName`, `lastName`, `city` columns of a `Customer` table. Will this index be used for `SELECT` queries based on only `first_name`, only `last_name` or only `city` values?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Multiple column index works on **left most prefix of the indexed columns**. It means the index will work on queries based on *first_name* only and index will not be used in queries based on *last_name*. \nTo elaborate the point following queries will use the index.\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE firstName='Smith';\nSELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE firstName='Smith' AND lastName='Jones';\nSELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE firstName='Smith' AND lastName='Jones' AND city='London';\n```\nThe queries like below will not use the index.\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE lastName='Jones' AND city='London';\nSELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE lastName='Jones';\nSELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE city='London';\n```"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the use of `SAVEPOINT` in MySQL?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"**SAVEPOINT** is like a bookmark while running statements in transaction mode.  I helps rolling back to a specific location in the transaction. Below command can be used to create  a save point while running MySQL in transaction mode.  \n```sql\nSAVEPOINT savepointName;\n```\nAnd current transaction can be rolled back to desired saved save point location by running below command.\n```sql\nROLLBACK TO savepointName;\n```\nUnlike **ROLLBACK** or **COMMIT** commands  which end currently running transaction, **ROLLBACK TO savepointName** does not end current transaction.\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is difference between _horizontal_ and _vertical_ partitioning? Does MySQL support both horizontal and vertical partitioning?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"**Partitioning** is used in database to split a table data into multiple parts called partitions and store them separately. It can further be classified into horizontal partitioning and vertical partitioning.  \n- **Horizontal partitioning** - rows which match a partitioning function are stored in corresponding partition.\n- **Vertical partitioning** - Different columns of a table can be stored in different physical partitions using vertical partitioning.\n\nMySQL supports horizontal partitioning but **does not** support vertical partitioning.\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":" How many tables can a trigger associate to in MySQL? Can a trigger be associated to a view?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A **trigger** in MySQL can be associated to a permanent table. It **can not be** associated to more than one table. Also a trigger **cannot** be associated to **temporary table** or **view**."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is `autocommit` in MySQL? Can you run a transaction _without_ disabling autocommit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"In MySQL, if *autocommit* is disabled, any command you run will not be committed automatically, which means changes made through these commands will become permanent only if **COMMIT** is called. By default *autocommit* is enabled in MySQL, which means any change we make is part of a single transaction, *commit* is done automatically and it can not be rolled back. \n\nIf *autocommit* is enabled you can call **START TRANSACTION** to start a transaction.  **START TRANSACTION** command makes the changes temporary until either **COMMIT** or **ROLLBACK** is called to end the transaction. "}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Provide an example of `UPSERT` logic using MySQL","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Use **ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE** to run a command which can do an **INSERT** and **UPDATE** if needed in a single statement. \n\nFor example if we have a **User** table with attributes *userid*, *name* and *mobilenumber*. Following statement will try to insert Alice to the *User* table. If a user with provided *userid* is already present in the table, the command will simply update the row.\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `User` (`userid`, `name`, `mobilenumber`) \nVALUES('11112227', 'Alice', '876876876') \nON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE name='Alice', mobilenumber='876876876';\n```"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is cursor used in MySQL? What are properties of MySQL _cursor_?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"**Cursor** is used in stored programs like stored procedure and stored functions. **Cursor** is a type of loop which can iterate through result of a **SELECT** query inside stored programs.  Here are some properties of cursor in MySQL.\n\n- **Read-only** - In MySQL, cursor is read only which means data of table cannot be updated using cursor. \n- **Non-scrollable** - It is non-scrollable which means one can traverse in forward direction with one entry at a time without skipping entries or moving in reverse direction. \n- **Asensitive** - It is asensitive which means cursor will not make temporary copy of the data rather use original data. One issue with cursor being asensitive is that if some other process changes the data while cursor is using it, result might not be predictable.\n\nConsider:\n```sql\nCREATE PROCEDURE curdemo()\nBEGIN\n  DECLARE done INT DEFAULT FALSE;\n  DECLARE a CHAR(16);\n  DECLARE b, c INT;\n  DECLARE cur1 CURSOR FOR SELECT id,data FROM test.t1;\n  DECLARE cur2 CURSOR FOR SELECT i FROM test.t2;\n  DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done = TRUE;\n\n  OPEN cur1;\n  OPEN cur2;\n\n  read_loop: LOOP\n    FETCH cur1 INTO a, b;\n    FETCH cur2 INTO c;\n    IF done THEN\n      LEAVE read_loop;\n    END IF;\n    IF b < c THEN\n      INSERT INTO test.t3 VALUES (a,b);\n    ELSE\n      INSERT INTO test.t3 VALUES (a,c);\n    END IF;\n  END LOOP;\n\n  CLOSE cur1;\n  CLOSE cur2;\nEND;\n```"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Compare MySQL and PostgresSQL","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"- **MySQL** is a **RDBMS** (relational database) while **PostgresSQL** is an **ORDBMS** (object relational database) which means apart from relational database, it also supports some object oriented language features like table inheritance and functional overloading.\n\n- Both **MySQL** and **PostgresSQL** are open source and free.\n\n- **MySQL** has better performance in case of simple queries. It gets this advantage as MySQL has less features in comparison to **PostgresSQL**. **PostgresSQL** has better support for complex queries. \n\n- **MySQL** is more popular than **PostgresSQL** so developer can get better support.\n\n- **PostgresSQL** is fully ACID compliant while **MySQL** is ACID compliant while using InnoDB. **PostgresSQL** is better choice than mysql for highly reliable applications.\n\n- Both **PostgresSQL** and **MySQL** have some **NoSQL** support but **PostgresSQL** has better support to NoSQL. For example **PostgresSQL** has better support to Json, XML and geometric types in comparison to MySQL.\n\n- **PostgresSQL** is compliant to SQL standard while **MySQL** is compliant to SQL standards to lesser extent."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Which _partitioning types_ does MySQL support?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"MySQL supports range partitioning, list partitioning, hash partitioning and key partitioning. \n- **Range partitioning** - rows are partitioned based on a certain range of column value.\n- **List partitioning** - rows are partitioned based on if column value is same as value provided in a  list.\n- **Hash partitioning** -  rows are partitioned based on hash of column value. Hash partitioning provides a more even partitioning. Hash is computed based on user defined hash function.\n- **Key partitioning** - rows are partitioned based on a hashing function provided by MySQL like MD5 hash."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are some major differences between MySQL and Oracle database?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Both **Oracle** and **MySQL** are relational database management systems supporting SQL. Here are some major differences between **Oracle** and **MySQL**. \n- **MySQL** is open source and free. **Oracle** provides express edition for free but it comes with limited features. **Oracle** provides enterprise level tools. \n- **Oracle** is better in terms of scalability. **Oracle** is suited for large scale enterprise level projects while **MySQL** is suited for small and medium scale projects. \n- While **MySQL** is Relational DBMS, **Oracle** has features of Object Relational DBMS. It supports more complex object relational model in additional to Relational DBMS supported by **MySQL**. \n- **MySQL** uses `mysqldump` or `mysqlhotcopy` for data backup. **Oracle** supports many options including Export and Import, Offline backup, Online backup, using RMAN utility, Export or Import Data Pump. \n-  PL/SQL is supported in **Oracle** while **MySQL** does not support PL/SQL. \n- **MySQL** uses username, password and host for security. Apart from username, password **Oracle** database provides features like profile validation for security.\n\nOverall **MySQL** is good for small and medium sized websites and read only websites. **Oracle** is good for highly scalable enterprise level applications.

What is difference between `TEXT` and `VARCHAR`?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Different text data types in **MySQL** include:\n* **TINYTEXT**, \n* **TEXT**, \n* **MEDIUMTEXT** and \n* **LONGTEXT**.  \n\nThese data types have different maximum size. While **TINYTEXT** can hold string up to 255 characters, **TEXT** can hold up to 65,535 characters, **MEDIUMTEXT** can hold up to 16,777,215 characters and **LONGTEXT**  can hold up to 4,294,967,295 characters.\n\n**VARCHAR** is also a variable text data type with some difference. **VARCHAR** is stored inline in the database table while **TEXT** data types are stored elsewhere in storage with its pointer stored in the table. A prefix length is must for creating index on **TEXT** data types.  **TEXT** columns do not support default values unlike **VARCHAR**. "}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What different _stored objects_ are supported in MySQL?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Different stored objects in MySQL include **VIEW, STORED PROCEDURE, STORED FUNCTION, TRIGGER, EVENT**.\n\n- **VIEW** - It is a virtual table based on a result set of a database query.\n- **STORED PROCEDURE** - It is a procedure stored in database which can be called using CALL statement. Stored procedure does not return a value.\n- **STORED FUNCTION** - It is like function calls which can contain logic. It returns a single value and can be called from another statement.\n- **TRIGGER** - Trigger is program which is associated with a database table which can be invoked before or after insert, delete or update operations.\n- **EVENT** - Event is used to run a program or set of commands at defined schedule.\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What does `OPTIMIZE TABLE` command do in MySQL?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A database table can be defragmented over the time. `OPTIMIZE TABLE` command can be executed to reorganize table data and index. `OPTIMIZE TABLE` command might be useful for tables which are **frequently updated**. It can help improve performance of I/O operations."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is _database engine_ or _storage engine_? Mention few storage engines supported by MySQL and their use.","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Database engines or storage engines are software programs which perform database operations like create, read, update and delete. Major storage engines supported by MySQL are **InnoDB** and **MyISAM**. Other storage engines supported by MySQL include **MEMORY, CSV, FEDERATED, MERGE, ARCHIVE** and **BLACKHOLE** storage engines.\n\n- **InnoDB** storage engine - default MySQL storage engine from version 5.5 and later. InnoDB is ACID compliant, provides transaction support and foreign key support.\n- **MyISAM** storage engine- default storage engine before 5.5. It is non-transactional.\n- **MEMORY** storage engine- it creates temporary database tables in memory. \n- **CSV** storage engine - it uses csv file for storing data. \n- **FEDERATED** storage engine - helps access data physically located in remote database server using a query to local database server.\n- **MERGE** storage engine - can be used to merge more than one table with identical column data into one table.\n- **ARCHIVE** storage engine - uses *zlib* compression to store archived data using less space, does not support indexing.  \n- **BLACKHOLE** storage engine - acts like a black hole, accepts data to store, does not store it and always returns empty. BLACKHOLE storage engine can be used in performance testing."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are differences between _MyISAM_ and _InnoDB_ database engines commonly used in MySQL?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Row level locking, foreign key support and transacation support are main features which differentiate InnoDB from MyISAM.\n\n- **MyISAM** was default storage engine before 5.5 while **InnoDB** is default storage engine from 5.5 and later versions. \n- **InnoDB** is ACID compliant ensuring data integrity while **MyISAM** is not ACID compliant. \n- **COMMIT** and **ROLLBACK** are supported by InnoDB. \n- **InnoDB** has row level locking, which makes it faster in highly concurrent cases in comparison to **MyISAM** which has locking at table level. With row level locking multiple sessions can simultaneously write in a table. \n- **Foreign key constraint** is supported only in **InnoDB** and not **MyISAM**. \nInnoDB is appropriate engine for payment related applications where transaction support becomes important. \n"}}]}</script><script id="_carbonads_projs" type="text/javascript" src="./MySql_files/CK7IV2JE.json"></script></head><body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"><div><spwc-custom id="spwcRandomPro" class="hydrated"></spwc-custom><spwc-custom id="spwcVisitors" class="hydrated"></spwc-custom><div aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true" aria-hidden="true" class="mdc-snackbar"><div class="mdc-snackbar__surface"><div role="status" aria-live="polite" class="mdc-snackbar__label">🎉 Yay!

It returns a single value. It can be used to store business logic and formulas in database. Stored functions can even run <strong>SELECT</strong> command or table manipulation commands like <strong>INSERT</strong> and <strong>UPDATE</strong>.</p><p><strong>The most general difference between procedures and functions is that they are invoked differently and for different purposes:</strong></p><ol><li>A procedure does not return a value. Instead, it is invoked with a CALL statement to perform an operation such as modifying a table or processing retrieved records.</li><li>A function is invoked within an expression and returns a single value directly to the caller to be used in the expression.</li><li>You cannot invoke a function with a CALL statement, nor can you invoke a procedure in an expression.</li></ol><p>e.g. <code>SELECT get_foo(myColumn) FROM mytable</code> is not valid if <code>get_foo()</code> is a procedure, but you can do that if <code>get_foo()</code> is a function. The price is that functions have more limitations than a procedure.</p><pre style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-shadow: rgb(0, 0, 0) 0px 1px 1px; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; direction: ltr; text-align: left; word-spacing: normal; white-space: pre; overflow-wrap: normal; line-height: 1.4; background: rgb(34, 34, 34); border: 0px; tab-size: 4; hyphens: none; padding: 15px; margin: 1em 0px; overflow: auto; border-radius: 8px;"><code style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-shadow: rgb(0, 0, 0) 0px 1px 1px; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; direction: ltr; text-align: left; word-spacing: normal; white-space: pre; overflow-wrap: normal; line-height: 1.4; background: none; border: 0px; tab-size: 4; hyphens: none;"><span class="token" style="color: rgb(194, 118, 40);">CREATE</span> <span class="token" style="color: rgb(194, 118, 40);">PROCEDURE</span> proc_name <span class="token" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">(</span><span class="token" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">[</span>parameters<span class="token" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">]</span><span class="token" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">)</span>

Major storage engines supported by MySQL are <strong>InnoDB</strong> and <strong>MyISAM</strong>. Other storage engines supported by MySQL include <strong>MEMORY, CSV, FEDERATED, MERGE, ARCHIVE</strong> and <strong>BLACKHOLE</strong> storage engines.</p><ul><li><strong>InnoDB</strong> storage engine - default MySQL storage engine from version 5.5 and later. InnoDB is ACID compliant, provides transaction support and foreign key support.</li><li><strong>MyISAM</strong> storage engine- default storage engine before 5.5. It is non-transactional.</li><li><strong>MEMORY</strong> storage engine- it creates temporary database tables in memory. </li><li><strong>CSV</strong> storage engine - it uses csv file for storing data. </li><li><strong>FEDERATED</strong> storage engine - helps access data physically located in remote database server using a query to local database server.</li><li><strong>MERGE</strong> storage engine - can be used to merge more than one table with identical column data into one table.</li><li><strong>ARCHIVE</strong> storage engine - uses <em>zlib</em> compression to store archived data using less space, does not support indexing.  </li><li><strong>BLACKHOLE</strong> storage engine - acts like a black hole, accepts data to store, does not store it and always returns empty. BLACKHOLE storage engine can be used in performance testing.</li></ul></div></div><div class="_Ew7U"></div><div class="_1Xy"></div><div class="_37BO"></div><div class="_a1Ym"></div><hr><div class="row my-2" style="font-size: 14px;"><div class="col-md-auto text-left my-auto"><span class="text-muted"><i>Having Tech or Coding Interview?</i>&nbsp;<span>Check 👉 <a href="https://www.fullstack.cafe/interview-questions/mysql" title="60 MySQL Interview Questions">60 MySQL Interview Questions</a></span></span></div><div class="col-md text-right hide-small"><span class="text-muted"><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="http://zetcode.com/mysql/storageengines/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What is _database engine_ or _storage engine_?

Here are some properties of cursor in MySQL.</p><ul><li><strong>Read-only</strong> - In MySQL, cursor is read only which means data of table cannot be updated using cursor. </li><li><strong>Non-scrollable</strong> - It is non-scrollable which means one can traverse in forward direction with one entry at a time without skipping entries or moving in reverse direction. </li><li><strong>Asensitive</strong> - It is asensitive which means cursor will not make temporary copy of the data rather use original data. One issue with cursor being asensitive is that if some other process changes the data while cursor is using it, result might not be predictable.</li></ul><p>Consider:</p><pre style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-shadow: rgb(0, 0, 0) 0px 1px 1px; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; direction: ltr; text-align: left; word-spacing: normal; white-space: pre; overflow-wrap: normal; line-height: 1.4; background: rgb(34, 34, 34); border: 0px; tab-size: 4; hyphens: none; padding: 15px; margin: 1em 0px; overflow: auto; border-radius: 8px;"><code style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-shadow: rgb(0, 0, 0) 0px 1px 1px; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; direction: ltr; text-align: left; word-spacing: normal; white-space: pre; overflow-wrap: normal; line-height: 1.4; background: none; border: 0px; tab-size: 4; hyphens: none;"><span class="token" style="color: rgb(194, 118, 40);">CREATE</span> <span class="token" style="color: rgb(194, 118, 40);">PROCEDURE</span> curdemo<span class="token" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">(</span><span class="token" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">)</span>
