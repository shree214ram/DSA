  1. memory save 
  2. At the time of adding dynamic child we dont need to be add again Event Listener 
  3. Less Coing 

  Example 1:- 
  we dont need to write click event at every option we can simply write at Parent and ,we  can add so many options dynamically 

  Example 2:- 
  we dont need to write same input onchange event  at every Input. we can simply write at Parent and ,we  can use data- for only those perticuler input .
