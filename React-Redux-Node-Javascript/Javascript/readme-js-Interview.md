What is an object in JavaScript?
JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.Apr 6, 2018

What is a class in Javascript?
Functions can be used to somewhat simulate classes, but in general JavaScript is a class-less language. Everything is an object. And when it comes to inheritance, objects inherit from objects, not classes from classes as in the "class"-ical languages.Sep 29, 2006

What is a scope in Javascript?
JavaScript has two scopes – global and local. Any variable declared outside of a function belongs to the global scope, and is therefore accessible from anywhere in your code. Each function has its own scope, and any variable declared within that function is only accessible from that function and any nested functions.Dec 2, 2014

What is a closure in Javascript?
A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables—scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer function's variables, and it has access to the global variables.Feb 2, 2013

What is currying in Javascript?
A technique using partial evaluation. Currying refers to the process of transforming a function with multiple arity into the same function with less arity. The curried effect is achieved by binding some of the arguments to the first function invoke, so that those values are fixed for the next invocation.Oct 11, 2013




What is the difference between using call and apply to invoke a function?


The difference is that apply lets you invoke the function with arguments as an array; callrequires the parameters be listed explicitly. A useful mnemonic is "A for array and C for comma."
See MDN's documentation on apply and call.
Pseudo syntax:
theFunction.apply(valueForThis, arrayOfArgs)
theFunction.call(valueForThis, arg1, arg2, ...)
There is also, as of ES6, the possibility to spread the array for use with the call function, you can see the compatibilities here.
Sample code:
function theFunction(name, profession) { console.log("My name is " + name + " and I am a " + profession +"."); } theFunction("John", "fireman"); theFunction.apply(undefined, ["Susan", "school teacher"]); theFunction.call(undefined, "Claude", "mathematician"); theFunction.call(undefined, ...["Matthew", "physicist"]); // used with the spread operator

Singleton pattern:



swap the value without temp variable in javascript


Suppose a and b are the two variables whose values need to interchanged, it can be done as


a = a + b
b = a - b
a = a - b.


Suppose a = 2 and b = 3 then,


 a = 2+3=5
 b = 5-3=2
 a = 5-2=3


Now,  a=3 and b=2.

String Functions 
Difference between slice , substring and sub str?
let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";

Sr.No
Slice
Substring
Substr
(7,12)
str.slice(7,12) (Start Index, To Index) = Banana
str.substring(7,12) (Start Index, To Index) = Banana Same
str.substr(7,12) (Start Index, To length {How much we have to run from start index}) = 
Banana, Kiwi
(-6,-12)
str.slice(-6,-12) (Start Index from end, To Index from end ) 

"Apple, Banana, Kiwi"
            12—---6------0
            ←—------------

= Banana
str.substring(-6,-12) negative always understand the 0 

= null (Nothing will print)


(-4)
str.slice(-4)= Kiwi , why because 
Start from -4 and not defined  last index so (0 because this is negative direction)
str.substring(-4)= Apple, Banana, Kiwi

Why because -ve number means 0 and the no last index defined so from 0 to the end of string . 
str.substr(-4)= Kiwi , why because 
Start from -4 and not defined length means upto last index (0 because this is negative direction)

str.substr(14,3) = ki

str.substr(14) = kiwi



Difference between var and let keywords?
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-var-and-let-in-javascript/
https://codeburst.io/difference-between-let-and-var-in-javascript-537410b2d707

Var can be access globally let in a scope like in loop or in if/else
var varVariable = “this is a var variable”;
 let letVariable = “this is a let variable”;
console.log(window.varVariable); //this is a var variable 
console.log(window.letVariable); //undefined
Let Hoisting
Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time. 
Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared: 
Example This is OK: 
carName = "Volvo"; 
var carName;
 Variables defined with let are also hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized. 
Meaning: Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError: 
Example 
carName = "Saab";
 let carName = "Volvo";

Var can be re-declare but the value will be same 
var carName = "Volvo";
var carName;
console.log(carName) ; output will be Volvo
But let can not be re-declare .
Blocked Scope :- 
{
 let x = 2;
}
// x can NOT be used here
{
  var x = 2;
}
// x CAN be used here

A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.

Closure :- clouser defined very well with Self Invoke Function here 
Initialized a counter  outer reach the goal but other outer can easily change the value of counter without call Add()
The outer side and inner side are also initialized but the block code will take every time 0 and result will be 1 only .
Remove outer still output is 1
