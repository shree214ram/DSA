# scope

    What is a scope in Javascript?
    JavaScript has two scopes â€“ global and local. Any variable declared outside of a function belongs to the global scope, and is therefore accessible from anywhere in your code. Each function has its own scope, and any variable declared within that function is only accessible from that function and any nested functions.Dec 2, 2014

What is hoisted in Javascript?
