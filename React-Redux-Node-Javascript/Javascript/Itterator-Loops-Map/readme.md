# What is looping structures are there in JavaScript?
In JavaScript we have the following looping statements:
while - loops through a block of code while a condition is true.
do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop while a condition is true.
for - run statements a specified number of times.


# difference between array.map and array.foreach
They are not one and the same. Let me explain the difference.
foreach: This iterates over a list and applies some operation with side effects to each list member (example: saving every list item to the database)
map: This iterates over a list, transforms each member of that list, and returns another list of the same size with the transformed members (example: transforming list of strings to uppercase)
