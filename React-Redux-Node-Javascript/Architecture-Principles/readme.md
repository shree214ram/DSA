# Difference between Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1724469/difference-between-single-responsibility-principle-and-separation-of-concerns

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)- give each class just one reason to change; and “Reason to change” == “responsibility”. In example: Invoice class does not have a responsibility to print itself.

Separation of Concerns (since 1974). Concern == feature of system. Taking care of each of the concerns: for each one concern, other concerns are irrelevant. Hiding implementation of behavior.
