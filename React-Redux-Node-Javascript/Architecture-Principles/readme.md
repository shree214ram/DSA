# Difference between Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1724469/difference-between-single-responsibility-principle-and-separation-of-concerns

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)- give each class just one reason to change; and “Reason to change” == “responsibility”. In example: Invoice class does not have a responsibility to print itself.

Separation of Concerns (since 1974). Concern == feature of system. Taking care of each of the concerns: for each one concern, other concerns are irrelevant. Hiding implementation of behavior.

# architecture 

1)      Have you worked on any complex architecture

2)      Have you used Separation of concerns principal in any of designing

3)      Have you used Don't repeat yourself (DRY) principal in any system designing  and architecture

4)      How do you apply the SOLID principles to functional programming and deep-level system architecture

5)      When would you use a component-based design

6)      How do you ensure security in design and solution of any system

7)      How do you achieve resiliency ,fault tolerance and availability of designing a services  .

8)      How do you manage data concurrency during auto scaling  

9)      How can you implement vertical scaling.

10)   How can you ensure availability  of services
