# Difference between Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1724469/difference-between-single-responsibility-principle-and-separation-of-concerns

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)- give each class just one reason to change; and “Reason to change” == “responsibility”. In example: Invoice class does not have a responsibility to print itself.

Separation of Concerns (since 1974). Concern == feature of system. Taking care of each of the concerns: for each one concern, other concerns are irrelevant. Hiding implementation of behavior.
 
# architecture 

1)      Have you worked on any complex architecture:-

       Yes , In the last company many complex applications were worked over them . 

2)      Have you used Separation of concerns principle in any of designing

       Yes , In the last company many modules I have used Separation of Concern design principle  . 

3)      Have you used Don't repeat yourself (DRY) principal in any system designing  and architecture

       Yes , so many applications we have used DRY concept , means repeated code should not be in our application .

4)      How do you apply the SOLID principles to functional programming and deep-level system architecture

       Yes , I know all the internal parts of Solid Principle very deep dive in various projects I have used  the same principle . 

       1. Single responsibility principle 

       2. Open/Close : Open for extension and close for update in existing code flow .  

       3. Liskew Substitution Principle 

       4. Interface Segregation 

       5. Dependency Inversion 

5)      When would you use a component-based design

       Yes , in all the react applications mostly component based architecture i have used   . 

6)      How do you ensure security in design and solution of any system

       Yes , i used some security points at the time of implementing any api  . 

       1. HTTPS / SSL / TSL Protocol use in api 

       2. Authorization {Security web token like Oauth JWToken} / Authentication {OPEN ID }

       3. Security validation at each side client/server 

       4. API Gateway 

       5. Prioritise vulnerability : As per the Role assign the operations 

7)      How do you achieve resiliency ,fault tolerance and availability of designing a services  .

      Yes I know all the important points of system design in which CAP theorem is the main point , which is responsible for fault tolerance and availability . 

8)      How do you manage data concurrency during auto scaling  

      Yes , data concurrency is related to data consistency. There are 3 ways to handle these things at the time of auto scaling .

      1. AWS EC2 auto scaling 

      2. AWS ECR docker containerization 

      3. AWS Lambda function is the most beneficial with respect to serverless cloud for low cost auto scaling 

9)      How can you implement vertical scaling?

    Yes , Vertical scaling is the option for scaling and increasing the size of the same machine once load increases . 

      

10)   How can you ensure availability  of services

Yes , With the help of Distributed System and Auto Scaling is a good way to ensure availability .

    1. contact with Interprice architecture and business architecture collect all requirments 
    2. understand the requirement 
    3. Design a High Level Design In terms of UML 
    4. Deside all Tech Stacks {A Well stablished version of tech stacks like MERN Stack, Database, }
    5. Cost Prospective Solution in terms of Scalling , Security , Flexibility {CLoud Services which is good feet as per the requirments and cost prospective}
