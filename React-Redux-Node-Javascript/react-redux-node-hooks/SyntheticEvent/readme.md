In order to work as a cross-browser application, React has created a wrapper same as the native browser in order to avoid creating multiple implementations for multiple methods for multiple browsers, creating common names for all events across browsers. Another benefit is that it increases the performance of the application as React reuses the event object.

It pools the event already done hence improving the performance.

Syntax:

 e.preventDefault() prevents all the default behavior by the browser.
e.preventDefault()
e.stopPropagation() prevents the call to the parent component whenever a child component gets called.
e.stopPropagation()
Note: Here ‘e’ is a synthetic event, a cross-browser object. It is made with a wrapper around the actual event of the browser. 


Some of the attributes are:

bubbles: Return true or false indicates event is a bubbling event or not.
cancelable: Return true or false indicates if the event can be canceled or not.
currentTarget: Indicates the element to which the handler is attached
defaultPrevented: Return true or false, indicates whether the event has been canceled by preventDefault().
eventPhase: Returns number, indicates the phase
isTrusted: Return true when the event is generated by the user and false when by the browser/script
type: Returns string, it indicates the type of the event
Note: Methods like preventDefault() and stopPropagation() are discussed further.
