1. remove loops and parallel adges 
2. arrange all adges according to minimum weight {Ascending order}
3. again make a new MST in which don't keep any adges because of that circle would present .
4. Addition of all the adges weight would be the MST Value and the graph will be MST graph .
5. For finding circle we need to learn Union find algorithm
