### Transitive closure mean a graph matrix which represents that j is reachable from i .
```
Given a directed graph, find out if a vertex j is reachable from another vertex i for all vertex pairs (i, j) in the given graph. Here reachable mean that there is a path from vertex i to j. The reach-ability matrix is called the transitive closure of a graph.
```
For example, consider below graph

### Transitive closure of above graphs is 
```
     1 1 1 1 
     1 1 1 1 
     1 1 1 1 
     0 0 0 1
```
