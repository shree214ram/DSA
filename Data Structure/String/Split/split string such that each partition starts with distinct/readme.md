Ways to split string such that each partition starts with distinct character

Input : s = "abb"
Output : 2
"abb" can be maximum split into 2 
partitions {a, bb} with distinct 
starting character, so k = 2. And, 
number of ways to split "abb" into 
2 partition with distinct starting 
character is 2 that are {a, bb} and
{ab, b}.

ab b
a bb 
a b b 


for(let i=0;i<str.length;i++){
    for(let j=1;j<str.length;j++){

    }
}
