Basically there are 3 methods same like Two sum 
1. Itrate 3 loop:-
    It takes o(n3) time compaxity
2. Two pointer :- 
    It takes o(n2) time compaxity and the sorting process is so lengthy like QuickSort 
    1. Sorting 
    2. outer loop for next count and inner loop will deside the Increase Left pointer Or Decrese Right Pointer 
3. Hashing :-
    It takes o(n2) time compaxity, whole array needs  to be traversed 2 times but it simpler than Two pointer  .
