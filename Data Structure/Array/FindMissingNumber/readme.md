Time, Space :-

1. Traverse two for loop O(n2) ( Sorted/Unsorted and +ve/-ve number)
    N^2 , N :- Two loop
    1. Sorted and +ve number
    2. Unsorted and -ve number (first we have to saperate +ve and work only on it)
2. Sort array Traverse one for loop O(nlogn)
    nlogn , nlogn
    1. Sorted and +ve number
    2. Unsorted and -ve number (first we have to saperate +ve and work only on it)
3. XOR Method  O(n) (Only in Sorted and +ve number)

4. Hash Map (n, n):- O(n) time on average, but it requires O(n) extra space
    1. Sorted and +ve number
    2. Unsorted and -ve number (insert in hash map only +ve number)
5. Advance (n,1) :-
