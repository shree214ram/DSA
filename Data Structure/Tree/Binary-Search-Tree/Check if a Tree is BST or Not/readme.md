https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-program-to-check-if-a-binary-tree-is-bst-or-not/?ref=gcse

# Approach 1(Normal but wrong method):-
Normal check if right is grater than root and left is smaller than root

# Approach 2(Correct But Not efficient):-
1. Max in left and min in right , if right min is less then Root Or Max is greater than Root then Return False {Means No BST}

# Approach 3(Lower and Upper Limit ):-
Upper and lower limit

# Approach 4(Inorder Traversing):-
1. Inorder traversal 
2. and check Sorted array is there or not , IN BST Inorder always in sorted array 
3. No need to check full array is sorted or not we can set 2 variable previous value if less then means Sorted
