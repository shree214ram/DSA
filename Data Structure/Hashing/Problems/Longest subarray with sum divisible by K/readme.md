Given an arr[] containing n integers and a positive integer k. The problem is to find the longest subarrayâ€™s 
length with the sum of the elements divisible by the given value k.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {2, 7, 6, 1, 4, 5}, k = 3
Output: 4
Explaination: The subarray is {7, 6, 1, 4} with sum 18, which is divisible by 3.

Input: arr[] = {-2, 2, -5, 12, -11, -1, 7}, k = 3
Output: 5
