Navie Approach :- 
Sorting and Greedy 
1. Sort asc array 
2. Minimum :- 
    we will take the minimum start from left to untill Remaining might be free 
    like 1 2 3 4 and we have 2 free then we will itterate loop till n-k means 2 
    will take 1 + 2 = 3 
3. Maximum :- 
    we will take the maximum starts from right untill Remaining might be free 
    like 1 2 3 4 and we have 2 free then we will itterate loop till n-k means 2 
    will take 4 + 3 = 7
